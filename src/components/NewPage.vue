        There's a new kind of coding I call "vibe coding", where you fully give in to the vibes,
        embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. It's possible because the LLMs
        (e.g. Cursor Composer w Sonnet) are getting too good. Also I just talk to Composer with
        SuperWhisper so I barely even touch the keyboard. I ask for the dumbest things like
        "decrease the padding on the sidebar by half" because I'm too lazy to find it. I "Accept
        All" always, I don't read the diffs anymore. When I get error messages I just copy paste
        them in with no comment, usually that fixes it. The code grows beyond my usual
        comprehension, I'd have to really read through it for a while. Sometimes the LLMs can't fix
        a bug so I just work around it or ask for random changes until it goes away. It's not too
        bad for throwaway weekend projects, but still quite amusing. I'm building a project or
        webapp, but it's not really coding - I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy paste
        stuff, and it mostly works.
